# BadlionClient-Flatpak
A Flatpak definition of Badlion Client, a Minecraft launcher

Based on the Lunar Client Flatpak manifest, since both launchers are packaged as an AppImage and are Electron apps
https://github.com/flathub/com.lunarclient.LunarClient

What I can't do:
- zypak-wrapper (launching minecraft crashes the whole launcher. There's probably a way to do this but I definitely cant.)
