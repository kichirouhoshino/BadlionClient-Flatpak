# BadlionClient-Flatpak
A Flatpak definition of Badlion Client, a Minecraft launcher

Based on the Lunar Client Flatpak manifest, since both launchers are packaged as an AppImage
https://github.com/flathub/com.lunarclient.LunarClient

What I can't do:
- zypak-wrapper (launching minecraft crashes the whole launcher. This is probably because Badlion ships with an ancient version of electron. Not entirely sure though.)
