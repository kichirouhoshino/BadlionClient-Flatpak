# BadlionClient-Flatpak
A Flatpak definition of Badlion Client, a Minecraft launcher

Based on the Lunar Client Flatpak manifest, since both launchers are packaged as an AppImage and are Electron apps
https://github.com/flathub/com.lunarclient.LunarClient

ToDo:
- Add Flathub Stuff (tho idk if I can put it in flathub.)
- Maybe use an Electron BaseApp instead of the included one? (This requires editing the AppRun script at build time to accommodate this)
